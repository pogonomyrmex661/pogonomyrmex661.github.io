*Petroglyphs on the Arizona Strip*


I started this blog because I wanted a way to remember and contextualize some of the neat things I come across.

So the posts in this blog were made in “Full Narcissist” mode. Sort of an online journal, I guess. It’s about whatever seems interesting or enjoyable at the time.

With that caveat in mind…I hope that you, also, enjoy this blog.
