I took advantage of another sunny Spring day here in Southwestern Colorado to get some _Pogonomyrmex_ _occidentalis_ photos from our back yard. I figured the mostly-cool temperatures would keep the ants relatively sluggish, while the sunshine would get them just warm enough to be active.  

That plan mostly worked out, in that I was able to get some photos of them without _too_ much drama.

I was again struck, though, by just how defensive/aggressive these ants are. They would catch sight of me from several feet away, then come running towards me with their jaws spread wide.

This behavior was disconcerting. When I'm photographing ants, I’ve got to get the macro lens within a couple of inches of the subject and hold it until I get a good focus. I also need to crouch low onto the ground if I want to get the low-angle shots that I prefer.

It’s hard to do that, and pay attention to the mechanics of taking the photo, when there are dozens of homicidal ants charging me.

These ants seem quite a bit more aggressive than other Pogos I’ve worked with, such a _Pogonomyrmex_ _barbatus_ and _Pogonomyrmex_ _rugosus_. I don’t recall being ‘chased’ by those ants, though it’s common with _Pogonomyrmex_ _occidentalis_.

I wonder if the increased defensiveness has anything to do with being a relatively high-elevation Harvester Ant, one that evolved with the great herds of Bison?

In any case, I was still grateful for these cool, sunny days, and the way they slowed these Pogos down.
