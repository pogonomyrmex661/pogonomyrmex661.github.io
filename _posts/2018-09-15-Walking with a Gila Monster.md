When we lived in Tucson about 15 years ago, we would come across Gila Monsters every now and then.

Finding a Gila Monster is a treat, a special occasion. They are visually stunning. The feeling of finding one is like finding apiece of beautiful, sentient jewelry.

I followed this one around for a couple of hours, watching  him as he hunted through the cactus and brush. He had a real sense of purpose about him - he was going places and looking for things.

He was on the hunt.

Some of the Gila Monsters you come across may look thin, emaciated. This one looked great, plump and happy. He was pretty good-sized, maybe 10 or 12 inches, I'd guess.

The day I followed this Gila Monster, there were many, many baby bunnies around. It was a hot day, and the bunnies were lounging in shallow scrapes in the dirt, cooling off. I took the picture above of one of the young bunnies while I followed the Gila Monster.

The Gila Monsters use their tongues, forked like a snake's, to taste/smell as they explore. As this one hunted, he'd taste the ground. When he found a spot that a scrape where a rabbit had rested, or a spot where a rabbit had peed, he'd stop for 20 or 30 seconds at the spot, flicking his tongue furiously.  I think he wanted to make sure he wasn't missing a rabbit that was still there.

*Gila Monster striding through the desert. The pink and tan pattern on the lizard, which looks so garish when seen out of context, helps the lizard disappear as it walks along.*

Something I think is especially interesting - the Gila Monster's colors, which look so distinctive when lizards are in the open, make them pretty hard to see when the lizards are in sun dappled brush.

The lizard would stop and rummage through patches of brush and cactus, presumably looking for bird or rabbit nests. In the photo above, you can see colors help him merge into the shadows and sun spots of the brush. It's actually easier to see him in the photo than in  life. The camera image 'stops' the lizard so that the colors appear distinct. In reality, he's moving, and his colors blur together as you try to follow him with your eyes.

The Gila Monsters are usually aware of your presence, but don't really seem to mind it that much. I've never seen one act aggressive/defensive in the slightest, though I understand that they may bite if handled.

What a fine day this was.
