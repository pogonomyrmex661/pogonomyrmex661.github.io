I brought a few Tiger Salamander larvae home a couple of weeks ago (July 5, 2022). I was planning to use a photo-aquarium to get a better look at some of the Leeches on the Tiger Salamander larvae.

Photographic the Leeches went pretty well, [I've posted about it here](https://tightloop.com/blog/2022/07/05/leeches-on-colorado-tiger-salamanders/).  What I wasn't expecting, though, was how _cool_ the Tiger Salamander larvae appeared in the photo aquarium.

I used the fiber optic light from a microscope as the light source. That let me light up the larvae quite strongly from arbitrary directions. Since it was a fiber optic light, I did not need to worry  about overheating the Salamanders.

I thought that I was going to have problems getting the light to shine on the larvae. I assumed that the larvae would move away once the 'spotlight' was on them.

I was surprised to find that the larvae _didn't_ try to avoid the light. They might even have been _attracted_ to it.

The strong light shining through the larvae had an 'x-ray' effect, so that I was able to photograph some of the internals of the larvae.

Some of my favorite shots were of the Salamanders' gills. The gills were so intricate, and so delicate. I could even see blood vessels running through the gills.

I'm astonished by strangeness, and the beauty,  and the delicacy, of these creatures.
