I went out to check on the Peregrines last week (May 8, 2023). I only saw the birds once, and they were a half-mile or so away.

I didn't see a prey exchange, did not hear them calling, but they are clearly together.

*Peregrine Falcons. The male (tercel) is to our left, and is chasing the hen.*

I'm wondering if they are going to [breed on their usual cliff](https://tightloop.com/blog/2020/07/09/peregrines/) this year. My suspicion is they are not.

I think that they are either just "playing house" or they've got an alternate cliff that they'll use for breeding.

I plan on rechecking in June. _If_ they are breeding, they should have late nestlings/fledglings then.
