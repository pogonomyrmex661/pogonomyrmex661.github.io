I've been fascinated by galls lately.

Most of the galls I've looked at have been induced by insects. This one, though, is caused by a Rust fungus. I'm thinking that it's one of the _Gymnosporangium_ genus, probably Cedar-Apple Rust, _Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae_.

*Closer view of the Juniper-apple Rust gall. The gall felt hard and dry.*

One of the interesting things about Juniper-apple Rust is that it requires two hosts. Part of its life cycle is on a Juniper, and the _other_ part of its cycle is on Apples, Service-berries, Hawthorns, or other plants in the Rosacea.

The Juniper gets infected by spores that come from the Apple. The fungus spores germinate on a Juniper twig, and "tell" the tree to grow a woody swelling, as in these photos.

*An end-on view of the rust gall. You can see that it completely surrounds the Juniper twig.*

Then, after rainstorms in the Spring or early Summer, the gall grows what look like tentacles - bright orange, gelatinous, spore-producing sporangia. This phase is the 'telial stage' and is quite dramatic. Sadly, I do not have photos of those.

The Juniper gall's "tentacles" produce spores for a couple of weeks, and these wind-borne spores infect Apples, Service Berries, Hawthorns, or other members of the Rosacea.

Here, the spores grow and produce yellow-orange lesions on the Apple's leaves and fruit. During the dry weather in the late Summer, these lesions sprout small tubes or cups, which, in turn, release spore-powder into the wind.

The wind-blown spores from Apples, Hawthorns, etc, go on to infect Juniper trees.

And the cycle starts all over again.

The infected Juniper may lose a few twigs or branches, but the infection doesn't seem to do much over-all harm to the Juniper.However, the Apple, Hawthorn or Service-berry infections can have serious effects on the infected plant, causing it to drop its leaves and fruit.
