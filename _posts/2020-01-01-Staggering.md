> I never thought they'd ever doubt my words I guess they were just too tired to care I'd point to the horizon, to the dust of the herds Still hovering in the air Somebody said it ain't any such Man you wish so hard you're scaring me

> 'Cause those are combines kicking up that dust But you can see what you want to see And go on chasing after what used to be there Top that rise and face the pain But man they were here, they were here I swear Not just these bleaching bones, stretching across the plain

These jaw-dropping photos were taken decades after the initial slaughter of the Plains buffalo.  The Buffalo were dead and the Plains covered with drifts of left-over Buffalo skeleton. The number of bones was so staggering that for years, they supported a bone-collection industry. Harvesting and processing the bones into fertilizer, bone black, filter media, and other industrial products.

We look back on this and say that we think it's a terrible thing. 

But you know what? Given what I've seen of humans, I'm pretty sure we'd do it again.
