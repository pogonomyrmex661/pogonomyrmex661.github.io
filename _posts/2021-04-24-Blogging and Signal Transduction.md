*The Blogger*

Lately I’ve been thinking about what a strange activity this whole ‘blogging’ thing is.

So...I go out into the desert, look for lost cities and cool insects. I try to capture images of these things, using the reflected patterns of radiation from a distant star.

While I do this, the neurons in my brain spark and flash, creating symbols telling me what I think about the above referenced reflected radiation. My brain converts these symbols,  these patterns of neuronal flashing, these ‘thoughts’, into ‘words’.

It turns out that ‘words’ are the export format for ‘thoughts’.

I use my fingers to transduce these ‘words’ into ones and zeroes that will live as a pattern of bits _someplace_, lord knows where,  interspersed with whatever recorded radiation patterns ("photographs") I’ve deemed most pleasing.

All of this is accomplished by using almost supernaturally powerful electronic devices, the workings of which I only vaguely understand.

That’s weird enough, even without thinking about the details of networked machines passing those bit-patterns around the world, and then into the nervous systems of other, hopefully less maladapted, primates. Perhaps to evoke feelings in those other primates similar to the feelings I had initially.

It strikes me as passing strange, is what I’m saying.
