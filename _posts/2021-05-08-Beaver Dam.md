description: Looking at a beaver dam on the Dolores River

*View of the dam. I like this shot because it shows the parabolic shape of the dam, and it emphasizes how neat this dam looks.*

I was driving along the Dolores River last week. This was before the recent heavy snow melt in the La Plata Mountains, so the Dolores was pretty low compared to most Springtime river levels.

The low river made it an especially nice surprise to see a Beaver dam stretched across a part of the river.

It was a low dam, probably only a couple of feet high, but it was at the top of a fairly sharp drop in the river's bed. The dam was long, perhaps 50 yards in length, and shaped like a parabola, with the apex pointing upstream.

*Beaver Dam on the Dolores River. It's not a high dam, maybe only a couple of feet over most of its length. But it was pretty long, I'd guess it was maybe 40 or 50 yards in length.*

I was inordinately pleased by seeing this dam. It's strange, though - I am used to seeing much taller and thicker Beaver dams in New Hampshire. I guess it's because the dams in New Hampshire are more difficult to see in their entirety due to all of the trees and other vegetation around them.

Speaking of vegetation and trees, I'd think the Beavers would find pretty slim pickings along this section of the river. Good thing I'm not picking dam locations for the Beavers, I guess.

*Another view of the Beaver dam, from farther downstream . It's located just above the whitewater in the left side of the photo.*

Since I didn't see a lodge, I'm assuming that the Beavers are living in burrows in the banks of the river. I've not seen New Hampshire Beavers living in riverbank tunnels, the ones I've seen have all had lodges. I can imagine all sorts of reasons why that would be the case.

I didn't see the Beavers themselves on this trip, just their dam. But I did see Beavers on the Dolores River a few years ago. I've included those photos in this post as well.

These Beavers ones were living in those exotic-to-me tunnels in the river bank, as well.

*Beaver on the Dolores River. You can really see the Beaver's wide, flat tail in this photo. Also, look at Beaver's hind feet, they are enormous.*

*Beavers on the Dolores River. Lodge is in the bank of the river - the entrance tunnel is on the upper left side of the photo.*

When the weather warms up a bit more, I think I'll go back to this new Beaver dam and snorkel in the upstream pool.

I suspect that will be a good deal of fun.
