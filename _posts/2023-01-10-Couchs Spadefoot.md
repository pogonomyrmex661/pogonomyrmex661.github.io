*Couch's Spadefoot on a rainy Tucson, AZ night - August 2005*

Over the last couple of years I've been doing a lot of posts and videos about Mexican Spadefoots (_Spea multiplicata_) in the Four Corners Area of Colorado. Here's a different Spadefoot - this is a Couch's Spadefoot (_Scaphiophus couchii_) from Arizona.

These little fellows would appear on damp nights in the desert around Tuscon during the Summer Monsoon rains. Like the Mexican Spadefoot, Couch's Spadefoot spend most of the inhospitable (dry and/or cold) time of the year buried underground.

During the Summer rains, they would emerge, eat, and breed like crazy, then dig themselves back into the dirt to await the next monsoons.
