I took the jeep through the Canyons of the Ancients this weekend.


On the way there, I came across a flock of Wild Turkeys. They walked through the dry and crispy desert vegetation, up the ridge, and out of sight. I knew we had Wild Turkeys here, but it was still a surprise to see them. I just don’t think of them as desert birds. Or at least I didn’t used to...

It had rained that morning, so the clay roads were slippery. I drove along through the rubble and broken canyons until I found a good spot, then got out and walked.

A pair of Redtailed Hawks circled low overhead as I walked along the valley floor and up a shallow canyon. I figured the Redtails were nesting on one of the cliffs nearby.

There were also at least two pairs of Ravens. They’d fly in rollercoaster patterns along the cliff tops,  back and forth, making strange clucking and glorking noises.

I noticed a cliff dwelling on the cliff wall. The ruin was on a low, broken cliff fronted with shattered boulder. I managed to climb up to the ruin ledge in a few minutes.

The doorway of the ruin looked fragile and I didn’t want to risk damaging it. I sat on the ledge outside the ruin, looked through the doorway and out through the ruined wall. Listened to the Canyon Wrens laughing and the breeze passing  through the stones.

It was a very nice trip indeed.
