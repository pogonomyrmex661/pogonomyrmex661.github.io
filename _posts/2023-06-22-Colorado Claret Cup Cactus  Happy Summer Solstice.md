I was hiking one of my favorite trails here in Cortez, Colorado a couple of days ago and came across these Colorado Claret Cup Cactus flowers. The morning sun was just catching the brilliant red flowers, making them glow, while the rest of the cactus was in shadow.

It was such a treat, seeing these.  

I wish you all a Happy Summer Solstice 2023 - may the year treat you well, and may all of your cactus flowers glow in the morning sunshine.
