These photos are from a trip I took in June of 2005, to Pinetop, Arizona. I was looking for ants, and I had put out some cookie crumbs as bait. This particular location had both _Camponotus_ and _Pheidole_ ants at the bait. I got a real kick out of seeing these together because of the disparity in sizes between the ants.

In the photo above, you can see the _Pheidole_ minor worker near the right front leg of the _Camponotus_ major worker. The _Pheidole_ is tiny next to the _Camponotus._ Comparing the two in size is a bit like comparing our size to that of a sparrow.

The _Camponotus_ were nesting in a nearby rotten log. Iâ€™m not sure where the _Pheidole_ nest was.

I think the _Camponotus_ is _Camponotus laevissimus_, based on the information at [Antwiki.org](https://antwiki.org/wiki/Camponotus_laevissimus).

Taking photographs of them was difficult - their bodies were an extremely shiny, almost metallic, black color that strongly reflected light. They also had those shining white hairs on their gasters. This combination made it tough to get a good, relatively reflection-free exposure in the photos.
