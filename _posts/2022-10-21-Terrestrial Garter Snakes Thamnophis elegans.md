In the afternoon, Jack the Hound and I usually walk down the driveway to check the mail.

And on three of the last four days, I've found a Terrestrial Garter Snake stretched out in the sun, either on the gravel of the driveway or on the asphalt of the road.

Each day, I've found the snakes in only slightly different locations, within a radius of perhaps thirty feet.

Each time, I've caught the snake and taken it back up to the house for photos, then walked it down into the pasture and released it, well away from the road.

Two of the Garter Snakes were small, it's _possible_ that they were the same snake on different days, though I do not think so.

The third snake was larger than the other two, and was definitely a different snake.

So. In the space of a week, I've found three different Garter snakes, within an area of thirty feet. At about the same time of day.

Here's another interesting observation. In the first week of October last year (2019), I found...a Terrestrial Garter Snake, stretched out and sunning in the road, in the same general location as the snakes from this year.

So here's what I'm wondering.

Lately the nights have been getting colder, with lows in the mid-30's F. The days are getting shorter, and are much cooler than they have been.

Are these Garter Snakes on their way to a hibernaculum? They will hibernate in groups, either in rodent burrows or in rock crevices.

And Lord knows that we have enough of both around here.
