I heard there was a colony of Acorn Woodpeckers living in Durango, Colorado. That seemed strange to me. I usually associate them with California, south-central Arizona and New Mexico...not Colorado.

So...I found some directions on the web a couple-few days ago, and off I went.

When I got to the locale, I saw a couple of large Ponderosa Pine snags. The largest was perhaps 100’ tall. Hmm. Was this the place? I glassed the larger snag, and saw that it was covered with holes,  like Swiss cheese. As I kept looking, I saw a flash of white on the tree trunk.

It was an Acorn Woodpecker! Well, that was easy.

The Woodpeckers drill holes in (trees, telephone poles, buildings...), then they go out and collect acorns. They use the holes as storage for the acorns. The birds stuff the acorn into a hole that is just the right size for the acorn.  As the acorn dries and shrinks over time, the Woodpeckers move the acorn to a new hole that is just snug enough, and so in.

Eventually, they eat the acorn. I’m not sure if they eat it when the acorn is just the perfect age, or if they eat it when they can’t find other food (winter, say, or if no mast years for a while), or what. About half of their diet is comprised of acorns.

They are social birds - groups of Woodpeckers will defend their trees from other Woodpeckers, and the group will communally raise young

Turns out that this location is one of two known breeding locations for Acorn Woodpeckers in Colorado. The other location was SE of Trinidad, Colorado, and I don’t think that Trinidad colony is extant any longer.

This Durango location has been active since about 1992, and has fledged young for at least some of those years (fledging birds seen at local feeders). I spoke with one of the folks that lived nearby, and he said that the telephone poles in the neighborhood are also full of acorn holes. I didn’t think to look at that, bet it was pretty neat.

I wonder how much longer these birds will live here...these snags aren’t going to last forever. I wonder if the birds will make do with smaller trees, as they do in Arizona.

And why are they here in the first place? Why, since they can live in this area, aren’t they more widespread? Is it just a question of bird-culture, are they a relictual population, or is there something special about this location?

Dunno. But it was great fun to see them.
