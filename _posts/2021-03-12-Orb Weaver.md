So this was kind of a cool thing. In August of 2001, I was visiting the Hawaii's Big Island. There were  big black-and-yellow orb-weaving spiders in the tree and bushes. I think they were a species of Garden Spiders - _Argiope_.

In one of the webs, there was also a smaller, gray spider. It looked a bit like the larval face-hugger form of the monster in the ‘Alien’ movie.

What on earth was this? I thought perhaps it was a kleptoparasite - a spider that makes a living by stealing the prey caught by another spider.

To make a long story short, I’m now pretty sure that the smaller spider was actually a male spider of the same species, living in the female’s web.

I did not know that males and females looked this different from each other. Very neat.
