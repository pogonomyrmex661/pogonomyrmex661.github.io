A felted wool sculpture by Heather Aquarius - Raven Steals the Moon. I put her sculpture up on the roof of the woodshed to get this shot with Mesa Verde in the background. There's just something...I don't know...satisfying? joyful? about these sculptures, and I just love photographing them. Hope you guys enjoy it, too.
