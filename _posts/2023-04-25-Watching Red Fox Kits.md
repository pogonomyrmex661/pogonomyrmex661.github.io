We were driving along the road yesterday and happened to notice a commotion in one of the roadside Prairie Dog villages. It was a pair of Fox kits, rolling and playing in the sunshine.

We watched a little bit longer. Another kit appeared...then another. There were four of them, all told. They would wrestle, then stop and look at each other, then wrestle some more. The kits looked boneless, they were so flexible as they tumbled around.

They also seemed to spend a lot of time scratching themselves. I'm thinking they might have fleas!

One of the kits picked up the remains of a wing. He'd strut around, taunting the other kits.

Eventually most of the kits disappeared, presumably back into the den. Just one kit remained, drowsing in the sun.

I am pleased to say that I have not lost any chickens for the last month, so the gory chicken-wing-plaything probably didn't come from my chickens.

This time!
