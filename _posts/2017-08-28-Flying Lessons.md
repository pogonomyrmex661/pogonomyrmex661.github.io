Amarillo, Texas was where I first learned how to fly. It was also the first place that I really remember while growing up. I was four or five years old at the time, and Amarillo was Paradise.

Mom had made me Batman cape out of blue satin. I was very fond of the cape, especially after mom taught me how to tie a bow so that I could put it on myself. 

I'd wake up at dawn and roam the housing area in my Batman cape. Amarillo was often windy, and I remember the tumbleweeds that would skitter by in the wind. The tumbleweeds seemed huge, they were not much smaller than I was.

At some point I must have seen a picture of Indians on horseback hunting buffalo, because I mentally transformed the tumbleweed into buffalo.  I remember running after the tumbleweed as fast as I could on my pretend-horse, Batman cape flying out behind me. Hurling my sidewalk-sharpened stick-spear through the buffalo.

The rule was that if the spear went through the buffalo and the buff kept going, it was just wounded. If the spear stuck in the ground and pinned the tumbleweed buffalo in place, that was a successful kill.

I remember, too, that around this time Dad made me some wings. Each wing was made of two pieces, one piece each for my upper arms, another set for my lower arms. This meant that I could bend my arms, making it far less cumbersome to wear the wings than a one-piece-per-wing approach. Dad had clearly put some thought into the design.  The wings were made out of rectangular pieces of cardboard, and were attached to me by arm straps. They were *wonderful*.

After Dad fitted the wings to my arms, he squatted down to my level and looked straight at me.

"Now you know these are just cardboard, right?"
"Yessir."
"These are not real wings. You cannot fly with these. You know that, right?"
"Yessir."
"You will not jump off of anything while wearing these wings, right?"
"Nossir."  
"Okay then. Go have fun...and try to stay on the ground."

I went tearing around the neighborhood in my Batman cape and my cardboard wings, arms outstretched and cape streaming behind me. I found that by running as fast as I could, into the wind, I could feel just the beginnings of lift, of flight. 

It was an exhilarating feeling. I was sure that if only I could run more quickly, I could get airborne. But *how* to go faster? 

 The solution problem came from an unlikely source. Mom and Dad had decided that religious instruction for me would be a good idea. So, once a week, they would drop me off at a local Sunday School for instruction in Texas Fundamentalist Spirituality.

This religious instruction mostly involved sitting in a circle with other children and chanting songs. 

We'd also watch re-enactments of Old Testament bible stories. The teacher performed these plays by moving pipe-cleaner figures around in a box half-full of what appeared to be cat litter. She would perform each character's lines with a different voice - gruff and deep for one, a quavering falsetto for another. She would pause occasionally and look expectantly at us, which was our cue to perform a specific chant or song. 

One of the central precepts of the Sunday School's teachings was that of biblical inerrancy - the idea that the bible was divinely inspired and therefore contained no errors. It was thus to be interpreted quite literally.

I had unfortunately generalized this belief to include *all other* written texts as well. This misunderstanding was to cause me no end of troubles in life. For this story, though, the most pertinent literally-interpreted text was from a book about Golden Eagles.

This eagle book contained the obligatory "Eagles and Man" chapter, which had an illustrated account of the tale of Daedalus and Icarus. They made their wings out of wax and eagle feathers. It worked pretty well until Icarus flew too close to the sun. His wax wings melted, and he fell to earth.

Hmm. Okay. So the take-home message from The Text was that the basic concept worked, but Icarus and Daedalus had chosen inappropriate materials. Good to know. I bet that if they had thought to use *cardboard*, they would not have had their material failure.

Since I could feel some lift from my wings when I ran, I was thinking that I all I needed was a higher elevation launching point. I'd gain speed as I slowly glided to earth, and then...true flight. I'd replicate, and then surpass, the performance of Icarus and Daedalus. I had modern *cardboard*, not something primitive like *wax*. 

So I found a brick wall that joined a house at a 90 degree angle. By pushing against the two walls, and using the exposed hands on my wings, I was able to clamber up the brick wall like some proto-Archaeopteryx. I reached the top and crawled out to the center of the wall, teetering as I stood up.

The wall can't have been very high, but it felt like I was at the top of the world. Wind whistling past me, my Batman cape fluttering straight behind me. The wind was pushing me, lifting against my wings.

I bent my knees and crouched, leaning forward into the wind. The wind seemed louder now. 

I imagined that once I got up to speed, the air would have a viscous quality as it supported me. I wondered how small our house would look when I was at altitude. This was going to be great.

Totally committed, I leapt forward and out into the air, wings spread at the perfect angle, legs trailing the way I'd seen birds do it.

A brief sensation of speed, much faster than I thought it would be - and I smacked into the ground. Really hard.

This was the first time I knocked the wind out of myself, and I think it was also the first time I sprained an ankle. I wasn't hurt very badly, though, and was able to get back to our house. I didn't dare tell Dad what had happened because he had explicitly told me not to do exactly what I had just done.

By now I was sure things had not gone for Icarus and Daedalus as recounted in my eagle book. I wondered if Icarus had felt this way when recounting his tale to Daedalus.

Daedalus would probably have been in kitchen, cooking breakfast. "Dammit Icarus what did you do? I told you to stay on the ground."

Icarus was probably embarrassed. He knew he needed a story. He would have blurted "Umm..well, it was the sun! You should have seen!" as he limped into Daedalus' kitchen.

Here's a funny thing. I adapted this writing from an email that I had sent to my sister a number of years ago. And when I wrote *that* email to her, I was recovering from a recently broken arm.  I had fallen off of a horse and landed badly. 

The thing is, I fell off while trying to replicate something I'd read in a book about horse training.

Proving that the "literary inerrancy" thing may still be a problem for me.
