Amarillo, Texas was where I first learned how to fly. It was also the first place that I really remember while growing up. I was five years old at the time, and Amarillo was Paradise.

Mom had made a Batman cape out of blue satin for me. I was very fond of the cape, especially after I learned how to tie the bow so that I could put it on myself. 

I'd wake up at dawn and roam the housing area in my Batman cape. Amarillo was often windy, and I remember the tumbleweeds that would skitter by in the wind. They seemed huge, not much smaller than I was.

At some point I must have seen a picture of Indians hunting buffalo on horseback, because I mentally transformed the tumbleweed into buffalo.  I remember gallop-running after the tumbleweed as fast as I could on my pretend-horse, Batman cape flying out behind me. Hurling my sidewalk-sharpened stick-spear through the buffalo.

The rule was that if the spear went through the buffalo and the buff kept going, it was just wounded. If the spear stuck in the ground and pinned the tumbleweed buffalo in place, that was a successful kill.

I remember, too, that around this time Dad made me some cardboard wings. Each wing was made of two pieces, a piece for each of my upper arms, another piece for each of my lower arms. This meant that I could bend my arms, making it far less cumbersome to wear the wings than a one-piece-per-wing approach. Dad had clearly put some thought into the design.  The wings were made out of rectangular pieces of cardboard, and were attached to me by arm straps. They were *wonderful*.

After Dad fitted the wings to my arms, he squatted down to my level and looked straight at me.

"Now you know these are just cardboard, right?"
"Yessir."
"These are not real wings. You cannot fly with these. You know that, right?"
"Yessir."
"You will not jump off of anything while wearing these wings, right?"
"Nossir."  
"Okay then. Go have fun...and try to stay on the ground."

I went tearing around the neighborhood in my Batman cape and my cardboard wings, arms outstretched and cape streaming behind me. I found that by running as fast as I could, into the wind, I could feel just the beginnings of lift, of flight. 

If I could only go faster, would I be able to actually fly?


The answer to this question came from an unlikely source. Mom and Dad had decided that I needed religious instruction. So, once a week, they would drop me off at a local Sunday School, where I would get instruction in Texas Fundamentalist Spirituality.

This religious instruction mostly involved sitting in a circle with other children and chanting songs. 

We'd also watch re-enactments of Old Testament bible stories. The teacher performed these plays by moving pipe-cleaner figures around in a box half-full of what appeared to be cat litter. She would perform each character's lines with a different voice - gruff and deep for one, a quavering falsetto for another. She would pause occasionally and look expectantly at us. That was our cue to perform a specific chant or song. 

It felt a little unsettling even at the time.

One of the Sunday School's central precepts was that of biblical inerrancy - the idea that the bible was divinely inspired and therefore contained no errors. It was thus to be interpreted quite literally.

I had unfortunately generalized this belief to include *all other* written texts as well. This misunderstanding was to cause no end of troubles in life. For this story, though, the most pertinent literally-interpreted text was from a book about Golden Eagles.

This eagle book contained the obligatory "Eagles and Man" chapter, which had an illustrated account of Icarus and Daedalus. They were imprisoned in a high tower until Daedalus made them each wings from wax and eagle feathers.  They leapt from the top of the tower and used their wings to soar to freedom. It was working beautifully until a giddy Icarus flew too close to the sun. His wax wings melted, and he fell to sea.

Hmm. Okay. So the message from The Text was that the basic concept would work, and flight was, indeed, possible. Icarus and Daedalus had trouble because they used inappropriate materials. That was good to know. I bet that if they had thought to use *cardboard*, Icarus would not have had his material failure.

Since I could feel some lift from my wings when I ran, I would follow Daedalus' pioneering work and find a higher elevation launching point. I'd gain speed as I glided to earth, and then...true flight. I'd replicate, and then surpass, the performance of Icarus and Daedalus. I had modern *cardboard*, not something primitive like wax and feathers. 

I found a brick wall that joined one of the houses at a 90 degree angle. By pushing against the two walls, and using the exposed hands on my wings, I clambered up the brick wall like some proto-Archaeopteryx. I reached the top and crawled out to the center of the wall.

I teetered as I stood up. The wall couldn't have been very high, but it felt like I was at the top of the world, with wind whistling past me and my Batman cape fluttering straight out behind me. The wind was pushing me, lifting against my wings.

I bent my knees and crouched, leaning forward. The wind seemed louder now. 

I imagined that once I got up to speed, the air would have a viscous quality as it supported me. I wondered how small our house would appear when I was at altitude. This was going to be great.

Totally committed, I leapt forward and out into the air, wings spread at the perfect angle, legs trailing the way I'd seen birds do it.

A brief sensation of speed, so much faster than I thought it would be - and I smacked into the ground. Really hard.

This was the first time I knocked the wind out of myself, and I think I sprained my ankle. I wasn't hurt very badly, though, and was able to limp back to our house. I didn't dare tell Dad what had happened because he had explicitly told me *not* to do exactly what I had just done.

I was sure that my eagle book's tale of Icarus and Daedalus was probably not accurate. I wondered what had actually happened, and if Icarus was as nervous about telling Daedalus as I was about telling my Dad.

Daedalus would probably have been in the kitchen, cooking breakfast. He would have looked up - "Dammit Icarus what did you do? I told you to stay on the ground."

Icarus was probably embarrassed. He knew he needed a story. He would have blurted something like, "Umm..well, it was the sun! You should have seen!" as he limped into Daedalus' kitchen.

Here's a funny thing. I adapted this writing from an email that I had sent to my sister a number of years ago. And when I wrote that email to her, I was recovering from a recently broken arm.  I had fallen off of a horse and landed badly. 

The thing was, I fell off of that horse while trying to replicate something I'd read in a book about horse training.

Proving that the "literary inerrancy" issue may still be a problem for me.
