description: Amarillo, Texas is where I first learned how to fly. It is also the first place that I really remember while growing up. I was four or five years old at the time, and Amarillo was Paradise.

*Flying Lesson*

There was a vacant lot near the Air Force base housing where we lived, and that vacant lot was loaded with skinks, tarantulas, and, best of all, horned lizards.

I would bring the horned lizards back to the house in a yellow pail full of sand. I'd keep them for a couple of days, then take them back out and let them go. I liked them because I thought they looked like triceratops, which were my favorite dinosaurs at the time. I loved the spikey feel of the horned lizards' upper bodies and heads, and the cool softness of their belly scales.

Mom had made me a blue satin Batman cape that I wore much of the time. I was very fond of the cape, especially after mom taught me how to tie a bow so that I could put it on myself.

I'd wake up early in the morning, roaming the housing area at dawn in my Batman cape. Amarillo was often windy. I remember the big tumbleweeds that would skitter by in the wind. The tumbleweeds were big, not much smaller than I was.

I must have seen a picture of Comanches on horseback hunting buffalo since I mentally transformed the tumbleweed into buffalo. They were Triceratops on some days, but mostly buffalo. I remember running after the tumbleweed as fast as I could on my pretend-horse, Batman cape flying out behind me, to hurl my sidewalk-sharpened stick through the buffalo.

The rule was that if the spear went through the buffalo/triceratops and the buff kept going, it was just wounded. If the spear stuck in the ground and pinned the buffalo in place, that was a successful kill (...and then what? Now My People Shall Eat Well? I don't think I had thought it through that far).

I remember, too, that around this time Dad made me some wings. Each wing was made of two pieces, one piece each for my upper arms, another set for my lower arms. This meant that I could bend my arms, making it far less cumbersome to wear the wings than a one-piece-per-wing approach. He had clearly put some thought into the design. The wings were made out of rectangular pieces of cardboard, and were attached to me by arm straps. They were _wonderful_.

After Dad fitted the wings to me, he squatted down to my level and looked straight at me.

"Now you know these are just cardboard, right?"
"Yessir."
"They are not real wings. You cannot fly with these. You know that, right?"
"Yessir."
"You will not jump off of anything while wearing these wings, right?"
"Nossir."  
"Okay then. Go have fun...and try to stay on the ground."

I went tearing around the neighborhood in my Batman cape and my cardboard wings, arms outstretched and cape streaming behind me. I found that by running as fast as I could, into the wind, I could feel just the beginnings of lift, of flight. It was an exhilarating feeling.

I was sure that if only I could run more quickly, I would probably get airborne. But *how* to go faster? 

 The solution to the speed problem came from an unlikely source. Mom and Dad had decided that a good dose of religion would have a positive effect on my life. So once a week, I'd get shipped off to a local Sunday School for instruction in a bizarre strain of Texan Fundamentalist Spirituality.

This religious instruction mostly involved sitting in a circle with other children and chanting strange songs. 

We'd also have weekly reenactments of Old Testament bible stories. The teacher would perform these plays using pipe-cleaner figures that she would move around in a box full of cat litter, which was a standin for the desert sands of the Middle East. She would do different voices for the different characters, and she would pause occasionally so that we could all perform a chant or song. 

One of the central concepts of the Sunday School's teachings was that of biblical inerrancy - the idea that the bible was divinely inspired and therefore contained no errors. It was thus to be interpreted quite literally.

This was probably a good and wise belief to instill in five year olds. I'm sure that having young children believe the two thousand year old mistranslated words of schizophrenics, delusionals and warlords is a fine idea, and that no harm could possibly come of it. But I digress.

I had unfortunately generalized this belief in literary inerrancy to *all other* written texts as well. This misunderstanding was to cause me no end of troubles while growing up. For this story, though, the most pertinent literally-interpreted text was found in a book about Golden Eagles.

This eagle book contained the obligatory "Eagles and Man" chapter, which had an illustrated account of the tale of Daedalus and Icarus. They made *their* wings out of wax and eagle feathers. It worked pretty well, until Icarus flew too close to the sun. His wax wings melted, and he fell to earth.

Hmm. Okay. So the take-home message from The Text was that the basic concept worked, but Icarus and Daedalus had chosen inappropriate materials. Good to know. I'll bet that if they had thought to use *cardboard*, they would not have had their material failure.

Since I could feel some lift when I simply ran, I was thinking that I all I needed was a higher elevation launching point. I'd gain speed as I slowly glided to earth, and then...true flight. I'd replicate, and then surpass, the performance of Icarus and Daedalus. I had modern *cardboard*, not something primitive like *wax*. 

So I found a brick wall that joined a house at a 90 degree angle. By pushing against the two walls, and using the exposed hands on my wings, I was able to clamber up the brick wall like some proto-Archaeopteryx. I reached the top and crawled out to the center of the wall, teetering as I stood up.

The wall can't have been very high, but it felt like I was at the top of the world. Wind whistling past me, my Batman cape fluttering straight behind me. I could feel the wind pushing me, lifting against my wings.

I bent my knees and crouched, leaning forward into the wind. The wind seemed louder now. 

I imagined that once I got up to speed, the air would have a viscous quality as it supported me. I wondered how small our house would look when I was at altitude. This was going to be great.

Totally committed, I leapt forward and out into the air, wings spread at just the perfect angle, legs trailing the way I'd seen birds do it.

A brief sensation of speed, much faster than I thought it would be - and I smacked into the ground. Really hard.

This was the first time I knocked the wind out of myself, and I think it was the first time I sprained an ankle. I wasn't hurt very badly, though, and was able to get back to the house. I didn't dare tell Dad what had happened because he had explicitly told me not to do...pretty much what I had just done.

By now I was sure things had not gone as described in my eagle book. I wondered if Icarus had felt this way when recounting his tale to Daedalus.

Daedalus would probably have been in kitchen, cooking breakfast. "Dammit Icaraus what did you do? I told you to stay on the ground."

Icarus was probably embarrassed. He knew he needed a story. He would have blurted "Umm..well, it was the sun! You should have seen!" as he limped into Daedalus' kitchen.

Here's a funny thing. I adapted this writing from an email that I had sent to my sister. And when I wrote *that* email ot her, I was recovering from a recently broken arm.  I had fallen off of a horse and landed badly. The thing is, I fell off while trying to replicate something I'd read in a book about horse training.

Proving that the "literary inerrancy" thing may still be a problem for me.
