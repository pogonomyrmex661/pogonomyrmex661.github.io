*Roseate Spoonbill sleeping. On High Island, Bolivar Peninsula, Texas. I love how this bird’s ear slit is open, looks almost like his eye.*

On our recent trip to the Bolivar Peninsula, Texas, we took a trip out to the Smith Oaks Rookery. It's one of the refuges managed by the Houston Audubon Society.  I’ll likely write more about this place later, but for now, I’ll just say that it was _mind blowing._

What  I really liked about this refuge, though, was the chance to not just _see_, but to to spend time and _watch_ all of these _spectacular_ birds. To get some feeling of their personalities, their behaviors.

At the Smith Oaks Rookery,  I got a chance to see them in a natural, more intimate setting. To see them as spectacular creatures in their own right, rather than just getting a glimpse of them.

To get a feeling for their…I don’t know…dinosaur nature, maybe?

Getting the chance to really appreciate these birds, as we did at the Smith Oaks Rookery…that was a gift.
