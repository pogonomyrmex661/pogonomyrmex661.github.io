Laurie said, "He’s right _there_. In the middle of the water. Look. _Look._ Look where I'm pointing."

Laurie and I had just entered the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge in Texas. We'd come hoping to see Alligators.

She had seen a good-sized gator in the canal off to our left. But I still couldn’t see anything.

"Okay," she said, "See that log over there, floating in the water?"

Yes, I said. And where is the Alligator, in relation to the log?

She smiled. "It _is_ the log."

Huh.

And as I stared, the log transformed into an Alligator head. Like a magic trick. A very disturbing one.

If I been a Raccoon, or a Deer, coming to the water to drink, would I have seen the Alligator?

Or would I have still been wondering where the Alligator was, near that ‘log’ floating in the water?

It’s funny, I started writing this post thinking that I needed to convey to you how good this trip was. To ‘sell’ the trip to Anahuac NWR. It’s one of the perils of blogging, I suppose.

But this trip, you see…it was something else. To be able to watch Gators in the wild this way…it was a religious experience.

If you don’t get what I’m worked up about, then you should probably forget about this, and just stay home.

But if you understand what I’m saying, then you should get down and see these Alligators as soon as you can.

It’s like a trip into our prehistory.
