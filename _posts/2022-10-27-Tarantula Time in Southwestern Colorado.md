It's that time of year again, when the male Grand Canyon Black Tarantulas roam the desert floor, searching for love and affection.

The newspapers like to refer to this annual mate-search as a "Tarantula Migration". That term has a nice ring to it, but the males are not really migrating. They live here - it's just that we can see them now.

*Grand Canyon Black Tarantula (_Aphonopelma marxi_).*

It's one of my favorite times of the year, something I [look forward to](https://tightloop.com/blog/2021/11/12/southwestern-colorado-tarantula-aphenopelma-marxi/). This year (2022), I started seeing them in late September. I'd come across one of them on every other hike.

They seem very purposeful as they stride along, stopping every now and then to investigate any holes they find that _might_ belong to a female spider.

*Nope, no female this time. The Grand Canyon Black Tarantula (_Aphonopelma marxi_) leaves the hole that he explored in the previous photo.*

*Today's hike - Snow!*

On today's hike it was cooooold, windy, and snowy. This cold weather will likely cramp the Spider-Dating for at _least_ a while.

I'm hoping that the Tarantulas were able to find happiness before this weather moved in.

Update 2022-10-31: It’s Halloween, four days later The snow has melted and it’s warmer than it was, but the nights are well below freezing. And what should I see today but a male Tarantula, out roaming.

Very nice to see.
