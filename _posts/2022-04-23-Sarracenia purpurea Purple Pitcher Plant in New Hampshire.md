On our recent  trip down to the Big Thicket in Texas, Laurie and I saw _Sarracenia alata ("Pale Pitcher Plants")].

That got me thinking about the Pitcher Plants that I used to see in New Hampshire. Those New Hampshire plants were a different species, _Sarracenia purpurosa_ - the "Purple Pitcher Plant".  I was struck by the big differences in pitcher shape between the _Sarracenia alata_ from Texas and the _Sarracenia purpurosa_ from New Hampshire.

These photos are from a trip that my Dad and I took on a rainy June 28, 2004 to a bog in Henniker, NH.

The bog was small, maybe about an acre. It was a "quaking bog" - we would walk on the waterlogged  Sphagnum Moss and the moss would shake and undulate as the water-waves passed through it. The feeling was like walking on Jello. If you stood in one place, you could feel yourself sinking into the thick, water-soaked moss.

It occurred to us that it would be pretty easy to sink up to our necks in soft spots in the bog, or fall into concealed lacunae in the Sphagnum mats. Fortunately, neither of these unfortunate  eventualities came to pass.

*This was a "quaking bog" - the surface of the bog would shudder like jello with each of our footsteps.*

The bog was surrounded by trees, and the bog’s surface had been invaded by shrubs and saplings. I'd been to this same bog ten or fifteen years previously and I remembered it as being a much more open area. I'm guessing that the site could benefit from a controlled burn.

*Dad looking at the Pitcher Plants. I do not know why we felt the need to visit this bog in the rain, but there we were. You can see the dense, low-lying shrubs on the bog surface.*

*Shrubs and tree saplings were growing into the bog at its margins.*

We saw numerous Pitcher Plants, but we didn't see _any_ Sundew Plants. Perhaps they were crowded out by the other vegetation?

The Pitcher Plants were in flower. That was pretty neat. Like the Texas _Sarracenia alata_, these New Hampshire  _Sarracenia purpuerea_ blooms were "nodding" on the end of their petioles so that the blooms faced down, towards the ground. The blooms were green, with reddish-purple margins.

These plants were beautiful. The rims  of the pitchers were were rolled almost like lips, and were a luscious red-purple color. These lips had a lot of ants on them, possibly a species of _Dolichoderus_. The ants were mostly stationary - I think they were licking secreted nectar off of the rims of the pitcher.

*Several ants (_Dolichoderus sp_?) on the lip of a _Sarracenia purpurea_ pitcher. Note the inward pointing hairs on the leaf above the slick, waxy lip of the pitcher.*

There were beads of moisture visible on the lips of the pitchers. I suspect most of the moisture was from the rain.

It's interesting to see the ants on the pitchers. Stephen Heard (1998) found that ants were about 70% of the prey captured by his population of _Sarracenia purpurea_.

Newell and Nastase (1998) set up video cameras to watch the visitors on Pitcher Plants, then tracked the outcome of each potential prey item. They found that 74% of the prey that were captured were ants.

Additionally, they found an _astonishingly_ low capture success rate - 0.83-0.93%. And, even though ants were the bulk of the captured prey by dry weight, the Pitcher Plant had an even _lower_ capture efficiency on them when compared with other prey species. The Pitcher Plants only a 0.37% efficiency with capturing ants (!).

Bauer etal (2014) came up with a model explaining how temporarily inactive traps in _Nepenthes_ Pitcher Plants could be of benefit to a Pitcher Plant when trapping ants. Their explanation was that temporarily inactive traps allowed Ant scouts to survive and return to the nest, thus recruiting more Ants to come back to the pitchers. Bauer etal's models showed that this temporary inactivation of traps allowed the _Nepenthes_ Pitchers to capture more ants over the long term.

Perhaps the low capture rate of the the _Sarracenia purpurea_ Pitchers is playing a similar, long-game with its Ants.

It's interesting to compare the _Sarracenia alata_ pitchers from Texas with these New Hampshire _Sarracenia purpurea_ pitchers.

Here is a photo of  some young _Sarracenia purpurea_ pitchers, from New Hampshire:[![](images/DSCN2755-1024x768.jpg)](https://tightloop.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/DSCN2755.jpg)

And here is a photo of a young _Sarracenia alata_ pitcher, from Texas:[![](images/IMG_5197-710x1024.jpg)](https://tightloop.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_5197.jpg)

Pale Pitcher Plant (_Sarracenia alata_).

Notice how the Texas _Sarracenia alata_ pitcher has a "hood" over the pitcher's opening, which would keep rain out of the pitcher. Look how the New Hampshire _Sarracenia purpurea_ pitcher opening has no hood. Instead, the _S. purpurea_ opening is flared out in a design that would capture the maximum amount of rain, like a funnel.

The _S. alata_ pitcher opening is small compared to the length of the pitcher, like a champagne flute, while the _S. purpurea_ pitcher opening is relatively wide, like a coffee cup. I think that the difference in shape becomes even more pronounced as the plants age.

Why are the pitchers different shapes? Why does _S. alata_ have a hood over the pitcher opening, while _S. purpurea_ does not? I've read that _S. purpurea_ gets almost all of its pitcher fluid from rain water, while other Pitcher Plants typically excrete the water themselves. Presumably, the _S. alata_ is trying to minimize evaporation of its fluid. Perhaps it's also trying to minimize the dilution of its excreted pitcher fluid by rainwater?

And since _S. purpurea_ is able to rely on rainwater to fill its pitcher, perhaps it can afford to have pitchers that hold a larger volume of fluid than _S. alata_?

Another thing that might explain the difference in the shapes of the pitcher between the two species - these New Hampshire _S_. _purpurea_ live in an area that is probably much more likely to freeze than the Texas _S_. _alata_.  I wonder if the larger volume of fluid in the _S._ _purpurea_ pitchers gives the pitchers a greater thermal inertia than the 'champagne flutes' of _S._ _alata_.

Neat stuff, in any case.

**Addendum:** I just came across this article by Marc Sudman: [A Sarracenia purpurea population in a peatland of Southern New Hampshire](https://cpn.carnivorousplants.org/articles/CPNv37n1p27_30.pdf) (Volume 37 of the Carnivorous Plant Newsletter (March 2008)).

I _strongly_ suspect that his article is about the same bog that my Dad and I visited in this post. How cool is that?
