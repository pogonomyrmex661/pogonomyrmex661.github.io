*_Hylaeus_ Bee on stamen of Rocky Mountain Bee Plant*

The most common bee on the Rocky Mountain Bee Plant was an insect that I initially didn’t think was a bee at all. I thought it was a wasp.

This is a ‘Cellophane Bee’ - a species inThe genus _Hylaeus_.


As you can see in the photo below, these _Hylaeus_ bees are quite small. Probably 3 or 4 mm long.

One of the reasons I thought these bees were wasps was that they _looked_ like wasps. They had a relatively elongate, body shape, and a black-and-cream facial pattern which made me think ‘wasp’.

*The _Hylaeus_ Bees appeared to eat the pollen, not carry it on their body hairs the way the other bee species did*

The other reason I thought they were wasps was that they did not have any of the specialized  pollen-carrying hairs that most other bees have.

The reason they don’t have those external structures is interesting. From my reading, the females of these solitary bees carry pollen back to the nest cells in their _crops_, not externally, on special pollen-carrying hair structures.

That’s why they were spending such a large amount of time eating pollen - they were provisioning their nest cells with the pollen.

*This is a male Hylaeus Bee, based upon the more extensive white patches on his face. These seemed to spend more time ingesting nectar at the flower stigma, the female part of the flower*

When they return to their nest cells, the females will regurgitate the pollen and make ‘bee bread’ with it. Then they’ll lay an egg on the ball of bee bread, seal off the cell, and start on another cell.

They are called ‘Cellophane Bees’ because they line the larval cells with a material they secrete that is a stiff film, like cellophane.
