description: The joy of seeing Gars in the wild for the first time
---

In late March of this year (2022), I was down in the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge. [I'd come to watch the Alligators.](/blog/2022/05/28/Alligator-Watching-at-Anahuac-National-Wildlife-Refuge-Texas/) I was slowly walking along the edge of the water. There were eight or ten gators on the other side of the water.

As I walked along, I saw two dots about a foot beneath the surface of the water. Were they eyes?

I stopped walking. The dots got closer and closer to the surface, and I could see that the eyes were on the end of a long tube. The portion of the tube that I could see was perhas 18" long, maybe 4" across.

Hmm. It wasn’t a Turtle. Maybe the black dots were eyes, and this was some sort of Salamander? But the shape and the size were all wrong. And as the shape got nearer to the surface, I could see that the eyes were back further on the head

It looked a little bit like an Alligator, but there were no bumps and ridges visible on the head.  

Then the form lunged up and forward with splash. I'd been concentrating on the form so much that the sudden movement and the splash gave me a quite a start.

*Gar swirls away from me. The gar's head is mostly off-screen to the right, and fish's tail fin is in the center of the picture, with its dorsal fin just to the right of it.*

Ah, it was a Gar! I'm not sure what _type_ of Gar - I'd guess an Alligator Gar or perhaps a Shortnose Gar.

I’m guessing the Gar’s lunge was either because I startled it, or it was grabbing a mouthful of air.

Now that I had the search image, I started seeing more of these fish as I crept along the banks. I could just barely make out their shapes in the murky water.I was surprised to see fish this large amongst the Alligators.

Why didn’t the Alligators catch them? Were the Gars too aware, too nimble for the Gators to catch? Or were the famous armour scales of the Gars too hard for these small- and medium-sized Gators?

On another day, when I visited the Smith Rookery on High Island, I was able to get some nice high-angle shots of Gars. I think these were Spotted Gars.

*Spotted Gar (_Lepisosteus oculatus_) hanging just below the surface. This was a good-sized fish, perhaps two feet long.*

These fish were in much deeper water than the Anahuac Gars. They would slowly rise through the murky water until they were at the surface, then slowly cruise forward.

*Spotted Gar (_Lepidosteus oculatus_) just below the water's surface. This one was perhaps 12-18" or so long.The Gar's head is toward the top of the photo. Near the bottom of the photo, you can see its dorsal and tail fins gently sculling the fish forward. There is a school of small fish passing from left to right, behind the gar.*

It’s funny. As a kid, I had really wanted a Gar for my aquarium. I could imagine few things as cool as watching a Gar up close.

Finally seeing these fish, this way, some fifty years later, I realize that this was the experience of Gars that I had really wanted.
