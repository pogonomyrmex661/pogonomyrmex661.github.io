**_May the Coming Year treat You and Yours_**

**_With gentle Kindness._**

_**Remember that Raven Claus giveth,**_

**_But Raven Claws taketh away._**

I cannot believe that the year has flown by so quickly, as on a Raven's wings. It has been a good year.

And now it is the Winter Solstice again. I wish a Fine and Happy Solsticemas to you all, and that you may find fascination and joy in the upcoming year.
