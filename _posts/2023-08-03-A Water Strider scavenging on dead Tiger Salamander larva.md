*Water Strider scavenging on dead Ambystoma Salamander*

Here's something I've not seen before - a Water Strider scavenging on a dead Tiger Salamander larva.

I was photographing Tiger Salamander larvae at one of my local ponds a couple of days ago (2023-07-31). This site is in a Ponderosa Pine forest in Southwestern Colorado, at about 7800'. There were a lot of Salamander larvae in the pond, and they mostly looked pretty good - swimming, foraging, etc.

There were, however, 8-10 dead larvae visible in the water. Some were floating on the surface, others were dead on the bottom of the pond.

I've [seen die-offs in this tank before](https://tightloop.com/blog/2019/08/06/more-tiger-salamanders/), and I'm not sure what causes it. It _might_ be related to the nutrient levels in the water from cattle grazing - the water smells pretty manure-y. It could also be a pathogen of some sort, or some other cause. I'm not sure.

I photographed a Water Strider that was standing over one of the floating Tiger Salamanders corpses. It stayed on the corpse for at least a five minutes. I was mostly interested in getting a better view of the round lesion on the Tiger Salamander's chest and I wasnâ€™t paying much attention to the Water Strider.

When I got home and looked more closely at the photos, I saw that the Water Strider appeared to have its sucking mouth parts piercing the Tiger Salamander's corpse.

I think this is interesting because, while I've heard about Water Striders scavenging dead insects, I've _not_ heard heard about them scavenging on dead vertebrates.

Pretty neat.

##### 2024 Update - This tank tested positive for ranavirus

Colorado Parks and Wildlife tested performed eDNA testing on this tank for ranavirus and two types of chytrid fungus. **This tank tested positive for ranavirus**.
