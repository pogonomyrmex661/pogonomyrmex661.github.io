*Dense clump of fighting _Tetramorium immigrans_. They looked like a seething mass of oil to me.*

I was walking through one of the city parks in Cortez, Colorado a couple of days ago and came across what looked like a black, shiny liquid that had been poured onto the edge of the sidewalk.

Looking a little more closely, I could see that it was a mass of fighting ants.

The mass of ants followed along the edge of the sidewalk for perhaps six feet or so. The mass was very linear - the ants did not spread more than six inches or so into the grass or onto the sidewalk.

*The _Tetramorium_ were fighting in dense clumps.*

These are warring _Tetramorium immigrans_ colonies. These wars usually break out in the Spring and early Summer, when the colonies are trying to establish their territories.

The ants pour out of their nests in masses and fight semi-formalized battles, looking like living oil spills.

"Formalized" because a lot of the fighting is ritualized - the ants pull and tug at each other, but don't go at each other in a full-throated attempt to kill.

"Semi-" formalized because some of the ants do, indeed, get killed in these competitions. Just not as many as you would expect, given the masses of fighting ants.

*A closer view of one of the dense clumps of fighting ants.*

Ants from one colony will grab ants from another, and pull. The victim ant will get (at best) spread-eagled, and at worst, pulled to bits.

*Still more fighting workers.*

This particular territorial dispute went on for at least two days.

_Tetramorium immigrans_ is very much a city ant in the United States. They seem to like building their nests in the cracks in sidewalks - hence the name "Pavement Ants".

Pavement Ants were introduced to the New World from Europe.

Originally, the scientific name for these ants was _Tetramorium caespitum_. Scientists have long suspected that there was more than one species of "Pavement Ant", though, and that calling them all "_Tetramorium caespitum_" was actually spackling over a lot of taxonomic....uh....difficulties.

In recognition of this problem, and I'm not making this up, the _Tetramorium_ that we have in the United States was renamed "_Tetramorium species E_" a few years ago.

This renaming struck me as being _immensely_ humorous. I wondered if perhaps _Tetramorium sp E [had been involved in a legal dispute with its record label](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_\(musician\))._

Fortunately, in 2017 Wagner etal (hopefully) resolved a lot of the taxonomic issues with the group. They used a bunch of DNA techniques, as well statistical treatments of the ants' morphological characters, to split the _Tetramorium caespitum_ cryptic-species complex.

I won't even pretend that I walked through their keys to identify these warring _caespitum_ complex ants.

Instead, I used the species ranges listed in the paper.

A rose by any other name, I guess.
