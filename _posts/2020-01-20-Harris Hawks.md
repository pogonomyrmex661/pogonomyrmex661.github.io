I recently spent a few days in Scottsdale for family matters. I also managed to get out into the desert early one morning. I went out looking for Harris Hawks.

I used to see a lot of them in Scottsdale, but in the last few years I havenâ€™t seen more than one or two. The land had changed so very much. It seemed as though all the places I used to go had been paved over.

I was wondering if the Hawks were still around.

While my old haunts were indeed barren, the hawks are still present in other places. I was able to locate a least three family groups that morning.

It made me pretty happy to find them.
