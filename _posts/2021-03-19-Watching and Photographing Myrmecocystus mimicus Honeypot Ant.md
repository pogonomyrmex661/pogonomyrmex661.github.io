Another ant that I found on yesterday’s trip to Farmington was _Myrmecocystus_ _mimicus_. These are a type of “Honeypot Ant”.

They were much easier to photograph than the _Pogonomyrmex_, since _Myrmecocystus_ can’t sting, and are not very aggressive. I think they had only started to emerge as I watched them, since they had not yet accumulated mounds of dirt outside their nest entrances.

The top layer of soil was dry, but it was moist an inch or so down. If you look closely at some of the photos, you can see little droplets of moisture on the ants.

I really enjoyed watching these ants on a fine Spring morning, their sleepy industriousness as they cleared the debris away from their nest entrances.
