*New Mexico Spadefoot Toad Tadpole - almost a toad. You can see that gelid mud-water of its pond coating my hand.*

_Birth of Eventually Venus - by Archibald Macleish_

> _Cast up by the sea_  
> _By the seventh wave_  
> _Beyond the sea reach_  
> _In the rubble of weed and_  
> _Wet twig_  
> _The not yet amphibious_  
> _Animalcula_  
> _Gasps and wiggles on the beach_  
> _Gathering her long gold hair about her_  
> _And gazing with pure eyes_  
> _Upon the unknown world_

I am fascinated by this Archibald Macleish poem.

The phrase "not yet amphibious", along with the line "gasps and wiggles on the beach", remind me of watching Spadefoot Toad tadpoles as they race to morph into toads. The fragile, miraculous hope of life.

*Newly morphed New Mexico Spadefoot Toad in my hand. You can just see a stump of the tadpole-tail.*

*New Mexico Spadefoot Toad in the shallow water of its pool, dead moths snow-flaked onto the water surface.*

Think what it must be like to be a newly morphed Toad. Leaving the water for a new life in a desert. How strange the world must seem.

I wonder if they are “...gazing with pure eyes upon the unknown world.”

*A drying New Mexico Spadefoot Toad pool. This one is on a dirt road, and is just an inch or so deep at this point. It's only got a day or two left before the whole thing will be just cracked mud.*

*A dead New Mexico Spadefoot Toad - this one wasn't quite able to turn into an adult toad quickly enough. You can still see its tracks in the mud.*

It's also strange to think how things we say and write can be re-interpreted over the years, twisted into meanings that we might not have had initially.

For example, I suspect that Mr. Macleish wasn't writing about tadpoles. Though I was _reading_ about them.
