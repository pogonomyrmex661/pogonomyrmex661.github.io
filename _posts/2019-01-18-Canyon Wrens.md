A year or so ago, I was out walking around the cliffs behind the Montezuma County Fairground. I came across a pair of adult Canyon Wrens and their three fledglings.

Usually I just _hear_ Canyon Wrens - they make a sort of descending "Hah hah hah hah..." call, it sounds for all the world like they are laughing. And since I'm usually plodding along ("hiking") when I hear the call, there is good chance that the birds _actually are_ laughing.

So I'm very used to hearing these birds - but not at all used to seeing them.

The fledglings were standing around with imperious expressions on their faces, and occasionally fluttering their wings, jumping up and down, and loudly begging.

The parents were frantically scouring the cliff face for food, trying to keep the babies quiet. The parents would dart away and disappear into rock crevices, then come racing back when they found an insect.

The fledglings followed along behind the parents in a loose mob.

An interesting thing about watching thsee birds - the angle of the rock on which they would perch didn't seem to matter to them. They seemed every bit as happy perching on a vertical rock face as on a horizontal one. They had huge, grappling-hook style feet that splayed out when they were hanginging on a rock face.
