*Fallen Saguaro fruit and _Forelius pruinosus_ ants*

One day in late June, 2003, I was walking through Saguaro National Park East. The Sagauro Cactus fruits were starting to ripen, and a few had fallen to the ground.

Looking at one of the fruits, I saw what looked like little red sparks walking on the fruits and heading away in a single-file line. What on earth?

I knelt down to look a little more closely.

There were tiny ants - _Forelius pruinosus_ - filing into theÂ  opening on the end of the fallen fruit. The ants were _gorging_ themselves on the sweet red juice inside.

They were eating so much of the juice that their gasters were swollen like over-filled water balloons with the bright red fruit juice. You could see the bright red fluid in their crops through the stretched membranes of their gasters.

I got a real kick out of seeing this. It was a little bit like watching bright-red animated Christmas lights walking along the desert floor.
