*The site wasn't much to look at - just scattered rubble. Given the size of the area and the number of mounds, there were a lot of structures here at some point.*

A few months ago, I was out roaming the Great Sage Plains with my Faithful Hound, Jack. We came to a series of clearings in the Sage, slightly raised hummocks that were covered with scattered rubble.

Hmm. This looked like an archaeological site.

I looked more closely at the rubble. Some of the larger stones had probably come from the ruins of the buildings that used to be here. The smaller "pebbles" I had noticed, though, were actually pottery fragments.

*More potsherds. In the background of the photo, you can see that they are numerous at this site. The larger rocks were probably part of the buildings.*

*A pottery fragment. This pottery was made from coarse, sandy clay - you can see the small stones in it.*

*A side-on view of the pottery fragment. From the radius of the curve, I'd guess it was part of an object that was perhaps 1 or two feet in diameter.*

The pottery was very plain, simple stuff. I didn't see any that had designs painted on it.

Scattered throughout the potsherds were what looked like old stone tools - lithics. There were a few that looked like hammer stones, others that looked like they had been used for grinding (manos and fragmentary metates).

The neatest thing, though were the little stone cutters that were scattered around.

*Stone cutting tool. It was strange to think that other people had held this tool. It felt very natural in my hand.*

These cutters were still very sharp. When I picked them up, they felt very natural in my hands.

From reading on Crow Canyon's website, and at the Dolores Archaeological Record, these sites are old. They’re from at least the BasketMaker (AD 600?) period. The structures were built before the cliff-side, fortress-like ruins that have made the Southwestern US famous.

My reading says that some of these sites were used over and over again through the centuries - built, abandoned, rebuilt, abandoned...

*There was a _Pogonomyrmex occidentalis_ (Western Harvester Ant) nest in the middle of the ruin site, surrounded by lithics, potsherds and building stones.*

There was a Western Harvester Ant (_Pogonomyrmex occidentalis_) in the middle of one of the sites. The ants had bits of pottery, lithics and old masonry scattered throughout their nest mound.

I thought this was kind of neat. The Hopi and other Pueblo Indians are descended from the Ancients who built these sites, so it's reasonable to assume that some of the Hopi's religious beliefs came from the Ancient Ones.

I've read that the Hopi believe that humans have lived in a series of worlds - the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Worlds. Between each of these Worlds, the previous World was wiped out by a cataclysmic event.

Between the First and Second Worlds, and again between the Second and Third Worlds, the Ant People sheltered and fed the Human People inside the Ant Nests, saving them from the ends of the worlds.

I like to think about those stories. This is one reason that makes I’m happy to see Ants tunneling deep into the ruins.

It seems fitting.
