In the Spring of last year (late May of 2022) I was hiking through an old Pinyon-Juniper forest here in Southwestern Colorado. This was at about 6500' of elevation.

I kept seeing an odd ooking plant, usually growing beneath Juniper trees.

Its leaves looked a it like those of a fern, but had small spines on the margins. They were a bit like a thistle. But the plants were neither ferns, nor a thistles. I assumed that that they were some sort of strange non-native annual.

I decided that I would need to wait until the Mystery Plants came into flower to get an identification. Perhaps they would blossom during the monsoon rains?

The monsoons came, and went. The strange plants disappeared as the Summer progressed. I didn't see any blossoms, and I assumed that these plant was just going to remain a mystery.

Then...in late April of this year (2023), I noticed some purple/white blossoms beneath the Junipers. It was the mystery plant - bloom!

I had been about a month too late to see its bloom last year. The flowers did not look at all as I had expected. They looked sort of Snapdragon-ish to me. Or maybe even like a Broomrape of some sort?

The leaves also had a purple-ish tinge to them, especially along their veins. I hadn't seen that leaf coloration last year.

Now that I knew what the flowers looked like, I was able [identify the plants](https://uswildflowers.com/detail.php?SName=Pedicularis%20centranthera) - they were a native specis named "Dwarf Lousewort" (_Pedicularis centranthera_).

These plants are part of a worldwide group of 600 or more different species of Louseworts(!).

I was curious about why they plants called "Louseworts". A "wort" is "...an herb or plant used as food or medicine...". The [word traces back through Old English](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wort#English), through Old forms of German, back to Proto-Indo-European.

The "Louse" part of its name was originally bestowed on other, Old World species of _Pedicularis_. Some sources say it's because cattle and livestock grazing on Louseworts tended to [become infested with lice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedicularis). Perhaps livestock hungry enough to eat Lousewort is likely to be in poor condition? Other sources say it's because "[...the seeds were used to kill lice](https://www.amazon.com/Field-Guide-Plants-Arizona/dp/1560445637)".

These plants are partially parasitic on other plants. Their Lousewort's roots can absorb water and nutrients from the soil, but they also penetrate the roots of nearby plants, allowing them to steal from their hosts. It's interesting - the Albuquerque Herbalism page mentions that the same _Pedicularis_ species may contain different alkaloids and other secondary compounds depending upon the host they've parasitized.

_Addendum_: It's early May of 2023 - and almost all of the _P. centranthera_ blossoms have already gone by. I can see why I missed the bloom last year.
