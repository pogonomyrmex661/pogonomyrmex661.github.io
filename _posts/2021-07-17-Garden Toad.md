*Woodhouse’s Toad hopping around an ornamental frog in our garden*

I found the Woodhouse's Toad out hopping around in the garden today. He was hanging around a plastic ornamental bullfrog in the garden.

I wonder if the toad views that large ornamental frog as some sort of “Colossus of Rhodes” monument from a previous amphibian civilization. There were giants in the Earth in those days; and also after that, you see.
