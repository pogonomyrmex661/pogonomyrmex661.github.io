In the Summer of 2024, I spent a few days watching and photographing native bees in Southwestern Colorado. Recently, as I was reviewing the images, I noticed something that I hadn't seen when I was taking the photos.

One of the _Melissodes_ bees had a small orange-brown larva crawling on her thorax.

Ah! This was a larval Blister Beetle - a triungulin! I had _finally_ found one!

First-instar Blister Beetle larvae are very, very different than their subsequent larval stages. They have legs and antennae and they clamber about, hunting for a host. They are quite active and aware of the world. There's a special name for a larva of this type a "triungulin" (plural "triungula").

In this case, the triungulin had found a female bee. It had climbed onto the bee, and was hoping to hitch a ride to the beeâ€™s nest.

*Melissodes sp. Bee with a Blister Beetle triungulin larva, indicated by the red arrow.*

Once the female bee inadvertently carries the triungula back to her nest, the triungula leave her and go to her offspring. The triungula molt into less mobile, grub-like forms. These sedentary larvae are more optimized for eating and growing, not moving and hunting. They feast on the bee's larvae, as well as the food the bee has gathered and stored for her larvae.

The differences between the first-instar triungula and the grub-like second- and third-instar larvae are so great that they could easily be mistaken for entirely different organisms. It's as though there were an extra stage added onto the beetle's life cycle. The magnitude of change is such that entomologists have a special term for it: "[hypermetamorphosis](https://bugguide.net/node/view/149682)".

When I think of triungula, I think of the [face-hugger in the 'Alien' movie](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/&ved=2ahUKEwimoqrJxNKLAxX9L0QIHQyKEfIQFnoECEsQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3iyZUKCugAN6_XLaRMdqpu). Like a triungulin, the face-hugger larva hatches from an egg, then actively hunts for a host. When the movie's face-hugger catches a host, it molts into an 'eating and growing' chest-burster form that lives inside the host. The chest-burster grows then "exits the host". After that, it molts into the adult alien form. Cinematic hypermetamorphosis!

I've written about some of the astonishing aspects of Blister Beetles and their life cycles [here](https://tightloop.com/blog/2024/03/15/oil-beetle-meloe-sp-blister-beetle/) and [here](https://tightloop.com/blog/2024/03/17/iron-cross-blister-beetle-tegrodera-aloga/). I've also [written about Rhipiphorid Beetles](https://tightloop.com/blog/2020/11/03/ripiphorus-beetle/), another beetle family that has triungulin larvae. But when I wrote those posts I only had photos of the the adult beetles - none of the triungulin larvae.

Ah, but now! I sat at my desk, staring at the photos and grinning. This was so cool.

After I calmed down, I started going through more of my bee photos.

And I I found _another_ triungulin, on a different type of bee! This one was from late June, also in Southwestern Colorado. It's on a Leafcutter Bee.

*A Leafcutter Bee - in the family Megachilidae. - gathers nectar and pollen on a thistle flower. She carries the white pollen grains on her belly. She's also carrying a freeloader - a Blister Beetle larva, at the base of her middle leg.*

This Leafcutter Bee is in a different family than the _Melissodes_ bee in the previous photos of this post. So is the triungulin a different species of Meloid Beetle? How host-specific are the Blister Beetles?

I don't know yet! But I'll be keeping an eye out in the coming year, for sure.

##### _Addendum:_

While researching and writing this post, I came across some [fascinating photos on bugguide.net](https://bugguide.net/node/view/1783939), by the bugguide.net user 'cotinis'. Those images show a pair of mating Tachinid flies - and the female Tachinid has at least two triungula on her thorax.

Did these triungula climb onto the Tachinid fly by mistake? Are they indiscriminate about whom they climb onto, just hoping that they will eventually be brought into contact with a female bee?

Some genera of Blister Beetles have larvae that prey upon Grasshopper eggs. So not all Blister Beetles are limited to parasitizing bees. Tachinid flies are often parasitoids of other insects...is that relevant in this case? Are these triungula 'hoping' to gain access to the Tachinid's prey? Or was it just happenstance that they are on the _female_ Tachinid?

It's funny how often the answers to questions ramify into more questions.

_A special thanks to the members of the Facebook '[Hymenopterists Forum](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hymenopteristsforum08)' for help with the identification of the bees and triungulin larvae. They are a fine, fine group, and they'll eat the _host's_ larvae while they are at it.p of people. Also note that any errors on this page are mine, probably brought about by my misunderstandings!_
