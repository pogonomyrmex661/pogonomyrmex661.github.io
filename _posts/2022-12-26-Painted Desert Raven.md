*Painted Desert Raven*

About a decade ago, I was making regular trips to Phoenix for family reasons. It was about a six, maybe seven hour drive each way. I did the trip so often that think I’d I had nearly worn grooves into the highways.  
  
On one of the trips I decided to drive the National Park loop through the Painted Desert instead of just sticking to the interstates. I stopped at an overlook where some Ravens were panting in the heat. We looked out over the Triassic Badlands together.  

Here’s a painting from that day.
