*Three-toed Dinosaur track in sandstone of Butler Wash*

I had heard that there was a three-toed Dinosaur track in the sandstone of Butler Wash, Utah. Last year I spent some time driving along Butler Wash, exploring side canyons, until I found it.

*Same Butler Wash Dinosaur track, with my hand for scale*

It was a small track, about the size of my hand. _Coelophysis_, maybe? Strange and wonderful to think that a little Dinosaur crossing through mud millions of years ago could unwittingly leave a trace that we can find today.

I was reminded of this track when I wasÂ [walking in the Canyons of the Ancients](https://tightloop.com/blog/2020/11/01/mustangs/) last week and found mustang tracks in the dust.
