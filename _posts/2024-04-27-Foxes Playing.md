*The first fox, the one with lots of black on its face and fur, ran across the field and lay down, watching the other fox.*

Laurie and I were watching television and eating dinner last night when our dog, Jack, came into the living room. He stared at me, then stared out the window, then stared back at me.

He seemed to be saying "Hey. You'll want to see this. Really."

We got up and looked out the living room window. Nothing. Looked out the front window, then the sunroom window. Still nothing. Maybe it's the horses, or the chickens?

I went out the front door. The horses were staring down the hill, and a herd of deer were running along the South edge of the pasture.

Then I saw a Red Fox run out of the trees and across the pasture, followed by a Black Fox. They seemed to be playing with each other, like puppies. They were ludicrously beautiful creatures.

I went back inside, and Laurie and I watched them through the sun-room window. The Black Fox ran to the edge of the pasture then lay down, staring at the Red Fox.

*The second fox, the red-and-silver one, casually walked by the black fox. Then sat down and scratched.*

*The Red Fox tried very hard to pretend that he was not aware of the Black Fox. The Black Fox gleefully came running over.*

*The Red Fox spun around at the last second, crouching in a "let's play" stance. The Black Fox whirled around and loped away.*

*The Red Fox loped away, following the Black Fox.*

We moved from room to room in the house, watching the Foxes as they loped down the hill together, through the Juniper trees and down along the creek. I thought about how cool it was to have seen these guys, and wished them well with their presumptive litter of Fox kits.

And I was accepted it with grace when Jack the Hound looked at me and said "See? I told you."
