*Rubble pile in plowed field. In Southwestern Colorado, a lot of these will be archaeological sites.*

Living in the Four Corners, we’re surrounded by archaeology. Sometimes it seems  as though the whole place is an archaeological site.

Case in point: you’re driving in Southwestern Colorado, pass by plowed fields, and you notice an unplowed island in the middle of the field.

There’s a _reasonable_ chance that you’re looking at a ruin site.

Gotta tell you, this blew my mind.  Can you imagine how many people must have lived here back then? I’m not sure that I can.

I’ve read that there were more people living in this area a thousand years ago than there are now.
