In September of 2005, I was out hiking in Arizona's Santa Rita Mountains. It was the first time I'd been there, and it was _wondrous_. Everywhere I looked, I saw some miraculous creature that I'd read about, but had not dreamt of seeing in-person.

A case in point - there was a column of Nasute Termites marching by the side of the trail. They were walking following a branch that was about a foot off of the ground, going from one dense clump of vegetation into another. It's the only time I've seen them walking in a column like that.

So...what's cool about these creatures? You may notice that the soldier caste has a strange looking head. The back of their heads are large and bulbous, and the front of their heads are drawn out into long, pointy 'nose' - the rostrum.

The rostrum is acts as a nozzle, and the soldiers use this nozzle to spray strings of sticky poison. In the words of [Thomas Eisner](https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Weapons-Scorpions-Many-Legged-Creatures/dp/0674024036), these soldiers are essentially _mobile artillery units_.

When they detect a threat, the soldiers shoot strings of sticky, glue-like toxic chemicals at the threat. When they spray, the soldiers jerk their bodies forward and back as they move their heads from side-to-side. These movements make the spray go out swirl like a sticky, toxic string, looping around the threat.

I think of these termites whenever I see people playing with those spray cans of [Silly String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silly_String):

As well as being toxic, the termites' sticky strings also contain an alarm pheromone, which attracts still more soldiers. The soldiers form a ring around the threat, 'covering' it with their nose-guns until the threat stops moving(!). The soldiers are blind, and seem to detect the threat's movements via air currents.

In the continental US, we only have two species of Nasute Termites. _Tenuirostritermes tenuirostris_ occurs in the Southeastern Arizona. _Tenuirostritermes_ _tenuirostris_ and T. _Tenuirostritermes cinereus_ occur in Southwestern Texas. Worldwide, though, the Nasutiterminae are much more diverse. I think there are at least 80 known genera.

Here's an interesting item I came across when I was reading up on these termites. I'm accustomed to the non-reproductives (workers, soldiers, etc) of social insects being females. That is emphatically not true of termites - they may have male or female workers and soldiers. Which seems strange to me, an ant person.

But then I came across this [statement of Dr Lee etal (2017)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00040-016-0523-x): "_...Rhynchotermes perarmatus h_as all male workers but all female soldiers_,_ while _Tenuirostritermes tenuirostris_ has the reverse_..._". If I'm reading that correctly, all _T. tenuirostris_ soldiers are male, while their workers are all female.

That strange popping noise you might have heard was my head exploding.

Termites are _weird_.

Note: I unfortunately did not get photos of the Nasutes marching in a column on that first day I saw them. The Nasute photos in this post are ones I took of Nasutes that I found while I was looking under rocks for ants.
