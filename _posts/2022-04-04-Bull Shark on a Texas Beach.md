*Bull Shark washed up on a Bolivar Peninsula beach*

A few days ago, I was driving along Route 87 in Texas. It’s a highway which runs the length of the Bolivar Peninsula.

There are several spots where the road comes _very_ close to the Gulf of Mexico. Sometimes I thought the waves would come right over the road, and it seemed as though I was looking up at the tops of the waves as I drove along.

I was keeping half an eye on the beach as I drove, trying to see if anything had washed onto the shore.

Suddenly - Holy cats! Was that a Shark?!


I turned the car around and found a place to stop, then I ran onto the beach.

Yup, it was a Shark.

The Shark was big, roughly six feet long, and _very_ dead. It was laying on its back. There was brightly colored cordage wrapped around its body and tail, and the cordage was entangled with masses of algae.

I couldn’t see the dorsal fin since the Shark was in its back, nor could I see its upper tail fin.

I had to cut my examination short for a number of reasons. For one thing, the tide was coming in, so I was examining the carcass between waves. The carcass was also going to be too heavy too move, assuming I wanted to get covered in rotting Shark juice. Additionally, I was not stopped on a good part of the highway.

So my ID of the Shark is very tentative. But I think it was a female Bull Shark, based on the size, the snout shape, and the teeth. If anybody has a better ID, please let me know!

This was a very bittersweet event for me. I love knowing that these magnificent creatures are still out there. And I’ve always wanted to get a good view of a large Shark.

But if I’m right about the way she died…well then, that was a crying shame.
