At the end of March, 2022, Laurie, Jack and I were walking along a trail in the Big Thicket in Texas. We were gobsmacked by how different the vegetation was from that of our native Colorado. This was a whole different world, like walking through jungle. So much life, so much water.

We noticed something small moving down in the bark fragments and pine needles at our feet. I thought at first that it was an earthworm, it was _that_ small - but it moved far too quickly to be an earthworm. It was about the diameter of a thick pencil lead, and was shiny and dry-looking.

Honestly, it looked like a piece of animated wire.

Hmmm. It was a tiny lizard, with a long tail, and diminutive legs. I was pretty sure this was a Skink of some sort. Perhaps a baby?

Skinks are famous for autotomizing their tails when handled roughly, so I didn't want to run the risk of trying to catch it with my big, clunky hands.

Fortunately, the Skink froze in place, allowing me to lay down next to it and take photographs.

It even let me get a photo with my thumb in the frame, for scale.

After taking a few photographs, we left the Skink in peace.

I later identified this lizard as a Ground Skink (or "Little Brown Skink"), _Scincella lateralis_. They spend most of their time rummaging through the leaf litter, eating small invertebrates.

They are supposed to be quite common within their range, and one of the smallest reptiles in the US.

I had not seen one before, though, and was inordinately pleased to have seen this one.
