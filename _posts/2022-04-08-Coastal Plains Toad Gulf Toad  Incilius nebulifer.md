Here's a Toad I came across last week on High Island, Texas. It was one of a pair of Toads I found under a piece of damp oak cordwood. 

As you can see, it had very dark skin, ochre strips on its back and sides, and scattered small yellow polka-dots on its back. Its parotid glands (the big lumps behind its eyes) had a vaguely triangular shape, and the bony ridges between its eyes were prominent and branched to form 'Y' crests near the parotids.

It's a Coastal Plains Toad! I was really hoping to see one of these on this trip. And to find _two_ that were this pretty...wow.

Besides its beauty, I was also struck by how dorsoventrally compressed the Toad was. You can kind of see it in this photo:

It peed on my hand shortly after this photo, indicating that it was distressed. I felt kind of bad about that, so put the Toad back under its wood, with other Toad.

An addendum:

When I started writing this post, I thought that this Toad was the "Gulf Coast Toad". And it was!

But...as I went to write this post, I discovered that this species of Toad have had a...confusing...set of name changes over the years.

Let me see if I can get this right.

When originally described, the Gulf Coast Toad's genus was named _Incilius_. Wikipedia's [entry for the genus _Incilius_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incilius) says that the name "...proved unpopular and these toads were known under the genus Bufo until the early 2000s". Huh. That's interesting.

So - until the early 2000s, taxonomists thought there was one species of this Toad, and it was called "_Bufo valliceps_", the "Gulf Toad". Its range stretched from Costa Rica all the way north to Louisiana.

Then scientists realized that _Bufo valliceps_ was actually at least two species. The more southerly population kept the name _Bufo valliceps_, and the more new, more northerly species acquired the name _Bufo nebulifer_.

The newly described (northern) species of _Bufo nebulifer_ also got a new common name - the "Coastal Plains Toad". _Bufo valliceps_, the species in the southern part of the range, kept the common name "Gulf Coast Toad".

Then scientists who were working on the toads realized that the original genus name, _Incilius_, had precedence over the genus name _Bufo_ that most everybody was using.

Sooo...the genus name for both _Bufo nebulifer_ and _Bufo valliceps_ changed _Incilius>, making the species _Incilius nebulifer_ and _Incilius valliceps_, respectively._

_Confused yet? It gets worse. Older field guides - you know, the type that I use - will still use the original, _Bufo valliceps_ name, and treat the two species as a single species when discussing them._

Additionally, it seems that a lot of people are _still_ using the common name "Gulf Coast Toad" for the northern species, properly called the "Coastal Plains Toad". Which makes a good deal of sense, what with it _being the Gulf Coast and all_.
