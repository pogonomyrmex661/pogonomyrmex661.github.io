One July day in 2004, I was out in the desert watching ants. Everywhere I looked, I saw something neat. We'd had monsoon rains a day or so previously and it had brought the desert to life.

I was sitting and watching a _Pheidole xerophila_ nest. These are small seed harvesting ants. Their workers are of two castes - small, blackish minor workers, and larger mahogony-brown major workers. The majors have heads that look enormous in relation to their body size. It's like watching bulldozers with legs. But the majors are he majors are surprisingly shy, so mostly the ants I was seeing were minor workers.

They were carrying seeds out of one of their nest hole. The seeds were, relative to the workers, enormous. Each seed was almost the size of a minor worker's head. Every now and then a worker would take one of the seeds into the nest, but mostly they seemed to be taking them out. I wondered if the seeds were too large, or tough, for the _Pheidole_ to eat?

As I watched, I saw a single red _Pogonomyrmex_ Harester Ant come up to the _Pheidole_ nest.

The _Pogonomyrmex_ was walking with its gaster tucked under, so that it was curved into a "C" shape.

*Pogonomyrmex desertortum worker pausing while looking for seeds. She would often move around in this hunched posture, even when no Pheidole nearby.*

From my readings, I suspected that this ant was  _Pogonomyrmex desertorum._

I've read that _Pogonomyrmex_ ants will take this hunched posture when they are laying a trail. I've also read that the act of curving the gaster forward like this ant exposes the openings to some glands, perhaps trail markers. The notion of the ant exposing gland openings by flexing its body, thus moving its various plates of exoskeleton armour, is very pleasing to me. I'm not sure why, but I think it's pretty neat.

Robert Johnson, in his 2000 paper on seed-harvesting ants, describes _Pogonomyrmex desertorm_ as a "Solitary Forager with Limited Recruitment". Cole, in his 1968 Harvester Ant book, mentions that _P. desertorum_ workers:

> ...move slowly, forage on trails at a steady gait, and frequently have the gaster turned downward as though they were laying a chemical trail.

Both of those descriptions fit what I was seeing. I had not seen this species before, I was pretty excited.

The _Pogonomyrmex_ walked closer and closer to the _Pheidole_ _xerophila_ nest that I'd been watching. But then something really cool happened. She started examining the seeds that the _Pheidole_ workers had brought out of the nest, even as the _Pheidole_ workers were all around her.

The Pheidole workers would gape their jaws at the much larger Pogonomyrmex. Some of the Pheidole would clamber over her.

The _Pogonomyrmex_ worker did not seem to be troubled by this attention. She worked her way closer to one of the _Pheidole_ nest entrances.

*Pogonomyrmex desortorum worker with seed, as Pheidole xerophila minors guard nest entrance. The nest entrance is under the stick.*

The _Pheidole_ workers would react to the _Pogonmyrmex_ when they got close to her, gaping and biting at her. But they were not very persistent, and did not seem frantic in their attacks. It was more as if they were saying "Hey! Get out of here!" than trying to do the _Pogonomyrmex_ harm.

Then the _Pogonomyrmex_ _put her head into the Pheidole nest entrance._

*Pogonomyrmex desertortum looking for seeds near a Pheidole xerophila nest entrance. She actually puts her head into the P. xerophila nest entrance at one point. On the left side of the photo, you can see a Pheidole minor with one of the seeds.*

"Oh!"  I thought, "Well! That's torn it! They'll react to that!"

The _Pogonomyrmex_ calmly took her head out of the nest, then started looking for more seeds. A couple of _Pheidole_ major workers came out of the nest, presumably in response to the _Pogonomyrmex_ putting her head into the entrance.

The _Pheidole_ majors came out of the various nest entrances, but were very calm. They didn't seem to be even looking for the _Pogonomyrmex..._just slowly walking around.

*Pheidole xerophila major workers would emerge from the nest, but did not engage with the Pogonomyrmex.*

One of the major workers had the severed head of a _Solenopsis aurea_, a Golden Fire Ant, clamped to her antenna.

Eventually, the _Pheidole_ minors started to mob the _Pogonomyrmex_. Again, not with any real persistence...more in a sort of "Go away now, please!" way.

The _Pogonomyrmex_ did walk away from the nest entrance, and most of the _Pheidole_ workers clambered off of her. One _Pheidole,_ however, stayed on the _Pogonomyrmex._ This worker was underneath the _Pogonomyrmex's_ thorax. While hanging upside down, she excreted a droplet of liquid.

*Pogonomyrmex desertorum worker with Pheidole xerophila minor on her underside. Note the fluid droplet at the tip of the Pheidole's gaster - I'm assuming this is a defensive compound of some sort(?).*

*Close-up of the Pheidole xerophila minor worker discharging a fluid droplet (see yellow arrow) while clambering on the underside of the Pogonomyrmex desortum*

I'm assuming that the droplet was some sort of defensive compound. The _Pogonomyrmex_ walked around a little bit more and gathered a number of seeds. She held them using both her mandibles and the scoop formed by her psammaphore - the "beard" of long hairs on the underside of her head.

Then the _Pogonomyrmex_ walked away from the _Pheidole_ nest, presumably back to her own.

I'm fascinated when I see encounters such as these  between species. It seems that the participants all know about each other, and what to expect from each other.
