Back when I lived in Tucson, Arizona, I would sometimes see strange-looking flies on the the Prickly Pear cacti. The flies were about the size of Housefly - maybe 4-5 mm long. But they had a rounded, almost humpbacked, appearance to them. They didn't move like flies, they scuttled over the Prickly Pear pads, running between the clusters of spines. They _could_ fly - they would fly away if you got too close. But they seemed to prefer...well, running around on the pads.

I noticed them especially in the Spring time. These photos are from a couple of different locations, but all are from April, 2005. There would often, but not always, be two of the flies near each other on the cactus pads.

Their rounded appearance was partially caused by the way they usually carried their bodies in a 'c' shape, with their abdomens bent forward. And, oddly, their wings bent sharply to follow that curve of their abdomen.

I got a few photos of them on young Prickly Pear Cactus buds, as well. They seemed to be feeding on the nectar that was flowing out of the flower buds.

###### A Puzzle, and a puzzle solved

Back in 2005, I had a hard time determining what these flies were. I came up with all sorts of tentative IDs, none of which really fit. I knew virtually nothing about fly taxonomy, and there are just so _very many_ species of fly. I didn't even know where to start looking...I gave up and forgot about the flies.

Recently, though, I was browsing through Stephen Marshall's book, [Flies - The Natural History and Diversity of Diptera](https://tightloop.com/blog/wp-admin/The%20Natural%20History%20and%20Diversity%20of%20Diptera), as one does. I came across one of his photos and thought - well, _that_ image looks familiar.

It was, finally, my mystery fly: _Stictomyia_, a "Picture Winged Fly". Now I had a tentative ID, I could look up more information.

Based upon [Elena Kamevena's 2006 key](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266332619_Myennidini_a_New_Tribe_of_the_Subfamily_Otitinae_Diptera_Ulidiidae_with_Discussion_of_the_Suprageneric_Classification_of_the_Family), there are two species of _Stictomyia_ flies in the US - _Stictomyia longicornis_ and _Stictomyia punctata_. The two can be distinguished by a couple of characters. One is the length of the antennae - _S. longicornis_ has relatively long antennae, and _S. punctata_ is relatively short. Another is by the black spots below the antennae - are they on raised calluses, or on a flat surface?

To my surprise, I seemed to have both _Stictomyia longicornis_ and _Stictomyia punctata_ in my photos. How cool is that?

I know now that I could have submitted the images to [inaturalist.org](http://inaturalist.org), [bugguide.net](http://bugguide.net), or one of the Facebook groups for an identification. What a marvelous time in which we live.

###### Biology and natural History

I haven't found a lot of information on the biology and natural history of these flies.

[Stephen Marshall's book](https://tightloop.com/blog/wp-admin/The%20Natural%20History%20and%20Diversity%20of%20Diptera) says that _S. longicornis_ frequents and breeds on _Opuntia_ cactus. He further suggests that at least _S. longicornis_ may be a beetle mimic, based upon their movement and the strange 'bent' way that the fly holds its wings.

[](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266332619_Myennidini_a_New_Tribe_of_the_Subfamily_Otitinae_Diptera_Ulidiidae_with_Discussion_of_the_Suprageneric_Classification_of_the_Family)

[WD Hunter (1915)](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Principal_Cactus_Insects_of_the_Unit/cGkoAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=stictomyia&pg=PA9&printsec=frontcover) described _S. longicornis_ as "...an extremely common insect throughout the cactus area." He mentioned that the larvae occur "...in any part of the cactus plant that may be injured".

[_Kameneva_ and Korneyev (2006)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266332619_Myennidini_a_New_Tribe_of_the_Subfamily_Otitinae_Diptera_Ulidiidae_with_Discussion_of_the_Suprageneric_Classification_of_the_Family) cite a 1913 reference that mentions rearing _S. longicornis_ from rotting cacti. I wasn't able to get a copy of the cited document, so don't have more information than that.

###### On Common Names

Many of the online and in-print images of _Stictomyia_ are labeled with the common name "Picture Winged Fly". I'm thinking that the source of that common name is _Stictomyia's_ parent family, the Ulidiidae, whose common name is - you guessed it - the "Picture Winged Flies". Since there are at least an estimated 700 species of fly in the Ulidiidae in North America, excluding Mexico ([Wallace 2021](https://cjai.biologicalsurvey.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cjai_2021_45.pdf)), that common name isn't terribly specific. Additionally, there are _also_ a number of flies in the Ulidiidae's _parent_ Superfamily that are called "Picture Winged Flies".

In his 1915 book "[The Principal Cactus Insects of the United States"](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Principal_Cactus_Insects_of_the_Unit/cGkoAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=stictomyia&pg=PA9&printsec=frontcover), WD Hunter suggested that _Stictomyia longicornis_ be called the "droop-winged fly". I'm not sure why that name hasn't caught on.

###### An Interesting Aside - Mites!

An interesting aside. As I was examining one of the photos of the _S. punctata_, I noticed that it had small pinkish/white mites on its head and thorax (see the two photos below).

*The same close-up of a _Stictomyia longicornis_ fly on a just-forming Prickly Pear flower bud in Tucson, Arizona...but with red arrows pointing to the mites. Phoretic Histiostomatid deutonymphs?*

I _think_ these are mites are deutonymphs - a non-feeding, dispersing stage of the mites' life cycle. They are phoretic - they aren't feeding upon the fly, but are just using the fly as a means of transportation. Given their appearance, I think that they might be in the Histiostomatoidea Superfamily. I'm basing that upon their general appearance and [this post on Bugguide.net](https://bugguide.net/node/view/242397).

[Wikipedia states that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatina) Histiomatoid mites feed on organic material and live in wet substrates such as dung, mud...and decaying plant material(!).

What better way for a mite to find decaying plant material in a desert than to hitch a ride with a fly that breeds on decaying cacti?
